What's up yo! Welcome to Yuzhou-Lab! My name is Yuzhou Ge, currently an undergraduate student from University of Southern California, studying both Applied Mathmatics and Computer Science!! But, but, but, in stead of writing softwares and boring math proofs, I am a big fan of doing film making, audio recording/editing, etc. Besides that, I do really enjoy playing tennis, marathon, swimming. Welcome to invite me to play with you! In this website(Yuzhou-Lab), I will post everything that I think it's interesting and useful, such as self-made videos, photography works, my poor Chinese Caligraphy works :( and Math/Computer Science Notes!(Excited?)
